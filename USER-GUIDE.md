# Regional KPI Dashboard User Guide (Non-Technical)

## 1. What this dashboard is for
The Regional KPI Dashboard helps you:
- View key performance metrics for your region
- Explore results over time
- Drill down into the records behind each metric
- View case studies
- Build custom reports

You do **not** need technical knowledge to use it.

---

## 2. Signing in
1. Open the dashboard link.
2. Enter your email and password.
3. If prompted, change your password.

If you cannot sign in, contact an Admin user.

---

## 3. Roles and access
The app supports three roles:
- `RPL`
- `Manager`
- `Admin`

Your role controls what you can see in the sidebar and which actions you can perform.

---

## 4. Main areas of the app
Use **View Mode** in the left sidebar:
- `KPI Dashboard`
- `Custom Reports Dashboard`
- `Case Studies`
- `Admin Dashboard` (Admin only)

---

## 5. Using the KPI Dashboard
The KPI Dashboard is split into tabs:
- Governance
- Partnerships
- Delivery
- Income
- Comms
- Case Studies

### Region and date filters
In the sidebar:
1. Choose `All Regions` or pick a specific region.
2. Choose timeframe (`All Time`, `Year`, `Quarter`, `Month`, `Week`, `Custom Range`).

All numbers and charts update automatically based on these filters.

---

## 6. How metric drill-down works
Each KPI tile can be clicked.

When you click a KPI tile:
1. A popup opens with related rows.
2. You can select a row for deeper detail.
3. The selected record is shown in a readable format.
4. If needed, open **Technical View (JSON)** for advanced detail.

### Important for Delivery > Total Participants
- You can select an event and see participant details.
- If names exist in source data, names are shown.
- If only IDs exist, IDs are shown.
- If only a count exists, placeholder entries are shown (for example, `Participant 1 (name unavailable)`).

---

## 7. Delivery demographics
The Delivery tab includes a demographics chart.

The chart title tells you the source:
- `Participant Cohorts (from people type tags)` when tag data is available
- `Delivery Split (by event type)` when cohort tags are missing
- Fallback representation when limited data exists

---

## 8. Case Studies
In `Case Studies`:
- Read existing case studies
- Filter by date and region
- Upload new case studies (if your role allows it)

If you can access all regions, use the sidebar region controls for case studies.

---

## 9. Custom Reports Dashboard
Use this area to:
- Select datasets (People, Organisations, Events, Payments, Grants)
- Apply date and region filters
- Build charts and tables
- Export CSV reports

---

## 10. Admin-only actions
If you are an Admin, you may also have access to:
- User management
- Manual Beacon sync
- CSV import
- Audit logs
- System refresh actions

Use these carefully, as they affect all users.

---

## 11. Troubleshooting
## The page looks slow
- Wait a few seconds after changing filters.
- Avoid very broad filters if you only need one region/time period.
- Try refreshing the browser tab.

## I cannot see participant names
- Names depend on source data from Beacon.
- Some events only provide counts, not names.
- After sync updates, attendee data may improve.

## A dropdown/list is hard to read
- The app includes high-contrast styles for drill-down controls.
- If you still see readability issues, report the exact tab and metric.

## I see no data
- Check your region and timeframe filters.
- Try `All Time` and `All Regions` to confirm data exists.

---

## 12. Best practice tips
- Start with `All Time`, then narrow down.
- Use drill-down to validate any unusual KPI value.
- For presentations, use the summary view; for investigations, use row-level detail.
- Download CSV from Custom Reports when you need offline analysis.

---

## 13. Glossary
- `KPI`: Key Performance Indicator (headline metric)
- `Drill-down`: Viewing detailed rows behind a KPI
- `Timeframe`: Date range filter applied to all metrics
- `Global`: All regions combined

---

## 14. Need help?
If something is unclear:
1. Take a screenshot
2. Note the tab, metric, region, and timeframe
3. Send this to your Admin/support contact
